# Automated Essay Scoring - Data Mining Team 9

This README provides instructions on how to run the code for the Automated Essay Scoring project and outlines each team member's contributions.

## Setup and Running the Code

### Prerequisites

Before running the Python files, ensure you have all the required dependencies installed by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Note: If there is any error with the installation of the gensim library, please install the Visual Studio Build Tools for C++.

### Project Structure

Main Folder: Data_Mining_team9
Contains the dataset and anotherfolder named Python_files.

Subfolder: Data_Mining_team9/Python_files
Contains the Python files for implementing the models. The code retrieves the dataset directly from the main folder using ../ notation.
Running the Code

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the Python files within the Python_files folder.

Additional Resources

Trained Models: Available on GitHub for direct use: 
Dataset: Available in the folder and also on Kaggle: ASAP AES Dataset on Kaggle
